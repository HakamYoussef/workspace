# Workspace UI

A Next.js front-end prototype for a unified work environment that blends email-style triage with a Notion-like workspace. The app is purely client-side and uses static sample data to illustrate the experience.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

If you cannot install Node or npm in your environment, you can still inspect the UI markup under `app/`.
